## Welcome to my GitHub!

# I have been using this place to mainly keep track of my learning milestones. It sort of serves as a portfolio as well, mainly because I store my Overleaf projects on here as well.
# I am a UoE Chemistry graduate, teaching myself data science in R, SQL, and mainly in Python.

I am interested in machine learning and AI, and just completing a project in constructing neural networks. Excited to learn to apply these skills to Chemistry and other related fields.
